# Architecture of Computing Systems Labs

This repository contains lab exercises for the **Architecture of Computing Systems** course, focusing on GNU Linux and NASM assembly programming.

## Overview

The labs cover fundamental concepts and practical skills in computer architecture, including:

- GNU Linux command line interface basics  
- NASM assembly programming and program structure  
- System calls in GNU Linux  
- Makefile creation and arithmetic operations in NASM  
- Conditional and unconditional jumps, branching  
- Loop programming and stack organization  
- Subroutines and number representation in assembly  
- File handling using NASM  
- Debugging using GDB  

## Lab List

1. **Basics of GNU Linux Command Line Interface**  
2. **Creating and processing programs in NASM assembly language**  
3. **Working with Midnight Commander (mc); system calls in GNU Linux**  
4. **Creating Makefile; arithmetic operations in NASM**  
5. **Conditional and unconditional jumps; branching programming**  
6. **GDB debugging; loop programming; stack organization**  
7. **Subroutines; representation of numbers in assembly**  
8. **File handling with NASM**  


## Requirements

- GNU Linux operating system
